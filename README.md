HomeWatch is a project to monitor your home remotely from anywhere that has internet access.

All you will need is to setup your home with cam server and some hardwares.Follow the guide to make your own home made monitoring system.

Things you will need:

A. For setting up the webcam server.
  1. A webcam/ or a Pi Cam
  2. Raspberry Pi (Recommended) /PC/Laptop.
  3. Internet Access. 
  4. Router with UPNP protocol support. (Don't worry if you have no idea about that. Just try the steps.)
Note: You don't need to have static IP or even you don't have to forward the port from your router configuration. The documentation will help to accomplish this via mapping the routing table.
